<!-- badges: end -->

{cheatsheet} is a simple R package that downloads [helpful R cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) from the repository maintained by RStudio.

## Installation

You can install the released version of cheatsheet from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("cheatsheet")
```

## Usage

The main function here is `cheatsheet::get_all_cheatsheets`. 
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(cheatsheet)
library(fs)

# Get all cheatsheets and place in a folder on your desktop
cheatsheet::get_all_cheatsheets(local_path = "cheats", tidyverse_only = FALSE)
fs::dir_ls("cheats")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Just grab core tidyverse cheatsheets
cheatsheet::get_all_cheatsheets(local_path = "~/Desktop/cheats", tidyverse_only = TRUE)
```

## Foreign language support

{cheatsheet} also lets you download cheatsheets that have been translated to over a dozen languages. Check which languages are available with this command:
```{r}
cheatsheet::list_languages()
```

Then, pass the language you want to this function:
```{r eval=FALSE}
cheatsheet::get_translation(local_path = "cheatsheet", language = "german")
```
